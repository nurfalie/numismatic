1. Verify that you have MySQL and Apache installed.
   If you do not, do not continue.
2. Apache should be configured as follows:
   * CGI enabled
   * SSI enabled
   * SSL enabled
3. MySQL should be configured as follows:
   * SSL enabled
4. Run the setup.sql script.
   (mysql -u root -p < setup.sql)
5. Modify the Makefile, particulary the CGI_PATH variable.
6. Run make. If problems arise, please modify the Makefile to suit
   your OS.
7. Run make install.
8. Password protect the Numismatic directory. This is the directory
   where the HTML files reside, not the CGI directory.
   This step is very important as userids are necessary for the program
   to function correctly. Look at the httpd.conf file.
   a. Modify httpd.conf, adding AllowOverride AuthConfig to the
      appropriate section (DocumentRoot).
   b. Execute "htpasswd -c /etc/apache-ssl/users user", where user
      represents the userid that you'd like to use.
   c. Create a .htaccess file in the numismatic.d directory that contains:
   	AuthName "Restricted"
	AuthType Basic
	AuthUserFile /etc/apache-ssl/users
	require valid-user
