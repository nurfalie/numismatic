1. Verify that you have Apache and MySQL installed.
   If you do not, please do not continue.
2. Apache should have CGI, SSI, and SSL enabled.
3. MySQL should have SSL enabled.
4. Execute the setup.sql script: mysql -u root -p < setup.sql.
5. Modify the Makefile, particulary the CGI_PATH variable.
6. Execute make. If problems arise, please modify the Makefile to suit
   your system.
7. Execute make install.
8. Password protect the Numismatic directory. This is the directory
   where the HTML files reside, not the CGI directory.
   This step is very important as userids are necessary for the program
   to function properly. Inspect the httpd.conf file.
   a. Modify httpd.conf, adding AllowOverride AuthConfig to the
      appropriate section (DocumentRoot).
   b. Execute htpasswd -c /etc/apache-ssl/users user, where user
      represents the userid that you would like to use.
   c. Create a .htaccess file in the numismatic.d directory that contains:
   	AuthName "Restricted"
	AuthType Basic
	AuthUserFile /etc/apache-ssl/users
	require valid-user
